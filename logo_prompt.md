# VerBeat Bot Logo Prompt

## Concept
Create a logo for "VerBeat Bot" - a Robot DJ with 3 knobs that represents a 3D versioning system.

## Core Elements
- **Robot DJ**: A friendly, modern robot character with DJ/audio equipment aesthetic
- **3 Control Knobs**: Each knob represents one dimension of the versioning system:
  - **Manual Knob**: For manual version bumps (semantic milestones)
  - **Calendar Knob**: For time-based versioning (year/month)
  - **Commit Knob**: For activity-based versioning (commit count)
- **Beat/Rhythm Theme**: Incorporate visual elements that suggest rhythm, tempo, or heartbeat

## Visual Style
- **Modern & Clean**: Professional but approachable
- **Tech-Friendly**: Should work well in developer/tech contexts
- **Scalable**: Must work as both large logo and small favicon
- **Color Palette**: 
  - Primary: Blues and purples (matching website gradient #667eea to #764ba2)
  - Accent: White/light grays for contrast
  - Optional: Subtle glow or lighting effects

## Specific Requirements
1. **Robot Design**: 
   - Friendly, not intimidating
   - Modern/contemporary robot aesthetic
   - Could have headphones, LED eyes, or other DJ elements
   - Should look like it's "mixing" or controlling something

2. **3 Knobs**:
   - Clearly visible and distinct
   - Could be labeled or have different colors/patterns
   - Should look like they're being actively controlled/adjusted
   - Could have small indicators or lights

3. **Beat/Rhythm Elements**:
   - Could include waveform, equalizer bars, or pulse lines
   - Subtle heartbeat or tempo indicators
   - Visual rhythm that suggests "beating" or "pulsing"

## Use Cases
- Website logo (header)
- Favicon (16x16, 32x32)
- Social media avatars
- Documentation headers
- Branding materials

## Technical Specifications
- **Format**: Vector/SVG preferred for scalability
- **Aspect Ratio**: Square or 1:1 ratio for maximum flexibility
- **Background**: Should work on both light and dark backgrounds
- **Size Variations**: Need versions for different sizes (large logo, small icon, favicon)

## Brand Personality
- **Smart**: Represents intelligent versioning
- **Rhythmic**: Captures the "beat" concept
- **Controlled**: Shows precision and control over versioning
- **Modern**: Appeals to developers and tech teams
- **Friendly**: Approachable and not intimidating

## Inspiration Keywords
- Robot DJ, Audio Controller, Mixing Board
- Version Control, Git, Development
- Rhythm, Beat, Tempo, Pulse
- Technology, Innovation, Automation
- Control, Precision, Management

## Deliverables Needed
1. **Main Logo**: Full VerBeat Bot with all elements
2. **Icon Version**: Simplified version for small sizes
3. **Favicon**: Minimal version for browser tabs
4. **Color Variations**: Light and dark background versions
5. **Monochrome**: Single color version for various applications

## Example Description
"A friendly robot DJ with a sleek, modern design. The robot has LED eyes and is positioned behind a mixing console with three prominent control knobs.
